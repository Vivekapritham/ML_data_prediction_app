Iris Flower Classification ‚Äì ML Web Application


This project is a machine learning-powered web app that predicts the species of iris flowers using physical measurements (sepal/petal dimensions). It features:

A Streamlit-based visual interface for model training, evaluation, and interactive predictions.

A Flask-based user authentication portal for secure prediction access with login/register functionalities.

Built using the classic Iris dataset, this app demonstrates how ML models can be embedded into modern web interfaces.

Requirements ‚Äì Libraries & Dependencies
Make sure the following libraries are installed in your local Python environment:


pip install streamlit flask pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
If you prefer, use a requirements.txt:


streamlit
flask
pandas
seaborn
matplotlib
scikit-learn





Full Application Flow ‚Äì End to End
1. Dataset Loading (iris.csv)
A standard dataset with 150 samples of iris flowers.

Columns: sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width, species.

2. Model Preparation (Shared by Both Apps)
Features (X) and target (y) are separated.

Data split into training and test sets using train_test_split.

Two classifiers are trained:

RandomForestClassifier

LogisticRegression


Streamlit Interface: streamlit_app.py

Future Scope:
This project is just a demo ‚Äì a working proof of concept for deploying ML models in web apps.

I‚Äôm currently working on a production-grade module that includes:

Full security with hashed passwords

User roles and access control

Docker containerisation
